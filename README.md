### 🤖 CodeAlpha – Python Chatbot (Task 4)

This is my Chatbot project for the CodeAlpha Internship (Python Programming  domain).
## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my implementation of **Task 4: Basic Rule-Based Chatbot** created for the **Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha**.

The purpose of this chatbot is to simulate small conversations based on predefined rules. It's a console-based Python program designed using core programming concepts such as loops, conditional logic, functions, and input/output.


## 🚀 Features

- 👋 Responds to greetings (`hello`, `hi`, `hey`)
- 🙂 Answers simple questions (`how are you`)
- 📴 Supports exit commands (`bye`, `exit`, `quit`)
- 🔁 Continuous conversation using loops
- 🛠 Detects unknown inputs and gives custom replies
- 🧹 Clean, readable, beginner-friendly code


## 🧠 How The Chatbot Works

The chatbot follows a **rule-based response system**:

- Takes input using `input()`
- Converts it to lowercase using `.lower()`
- Uses **if-elif-else** logic to match responses
- Runs inside a `while True` loop to stay active
- Stops only when `break` is executed on exit commands


## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
Through this task, I was able to practice and strengthen:

- Control flow using if-elif conditions
- Using while True loops for continuous input
- Clean code structuring in Python
- Handling user input safely
- Understanding rule-based response models

🙏 Acknowledgment
This project is completed as part of my CodeAlpha Python Internship.
I would like to thank the CodeAlpha team for the opportunity and guidance.
